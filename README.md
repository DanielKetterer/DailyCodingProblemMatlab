# DailyCodingProblemMatlab
Matlab implementations of the daily coding problem 

Each of these exercises is one of the Daily Coding Problem emails I receive, with interview questions asked by Facebook, Google, Uber and more.

I have implemented  solutions with comments in this space. In some exercises I will post a generalization of the solution to the problem

If you find more efficient solutions, let me know! I am always hungry for feedback.
Enjoy!
